This SOAP Webservice is running on nodejs. Before start, your envirionment need npm to manage packages. Run

```sh
$ npm install
```

To start the server, enter the following command at the root directory.

```sh
$ node index.js
```

And now we have the server that handle requests. I have created the example client named _client.js_, you can try it by enter the following command.

```sh
$ node client.js
```

Thanks.
